The echo function takes in the text to be echoed and the number of times it is echoed. It prints the echos and returns a "." when finished. When the program is run, it asks the user to yell something at a mountain and waits for user input. 
With the input "Helloooo", the code outputs the text below.

With the input "echo 123", the code outputs the text below.
